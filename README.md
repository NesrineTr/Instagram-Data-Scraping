# Instagram-Data-Scraping
This project scrapes Instagram business profiles based on hashtags. It uses Selenium to log in, search for a hashtag, and extract usernames of accounts posting under that tag. The scripts automatically scroll, collect post URLs, and gather profile information for analysis or marketing purposes.
